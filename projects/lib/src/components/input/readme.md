# 输入框

Easily extend form controls by adding text, buttons, or button groups on either side of textual inputs, custom selects, and custom file inputs.

## Basic example
Place one add-on or button on either side of an input. You may also place one on both sides of an input. Remember to place <label>s outside the input group.
